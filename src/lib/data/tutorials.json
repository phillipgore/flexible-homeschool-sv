For instance, a family may have shared Art and Music Appreciation at the beginning of their school day called “Morning Time”. This is a nice feature for shared school experiences, but most of the time you will be adding School Work for each individual Student.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span class=\"cl-success\">Naming: </span>Next give the School Work a name. A good naming convention is to state the subject first, followed by a colon or dash, and then the name of the School Work. For instance, \"Literature: Gulliver's Travels\" and \"Literature: History of English Lit\". This will keep all of the work for a particular subject listed together in the tracking section.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span class=\"cl-success\">General Instructions: </span>The general instructions field is great for broad instructions like, “Read three chapters a week”. or “Do two sections in your work book each week”.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"well well-primary p-tn-9 m-tn-b-18 m-sm-h-18 m-md-h-36 m-lg-h-54\">\r\n\t<div class=\"well-icon\"><i class=\"fss-info\"></i></div>\r\n\t<div class=\"well-message\">\r\n\t\t<p class=\"m-tn-b-0\">Providing general instructions on how to complete a School Work item over the course of the School Year can be key.

    "content": "<div class=\"clearfix\">\r\n\t<div class=\"video-container col-tn-1of1 col-lg-4of5 p-tn-b-18\">\r\n\t\t<div class=\"video-responsive\">\r\n\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WOsS7VsHoPA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Flexible Homeschool App is designed around the concept of Flexible Timeframes rather than specific dates on a calendar. Understanding the basics of this concept will help you get started with the app.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"p-tn-t-18 m-tn-b-9\">School Years</h3>\r\n<p>In many ways we already use the concept of flexible timeframes in our everyday homeschool life. For instance, we think of a School Year as a flexible span of time. It can have starts and stops. It’s not a specific period of 12 months. In our minds a School Year is a rather flexible concept.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"p-tn-t-18 m-tn-b-9\">Terms</h3>\r\n<p>Terms have flexibility built into them as well. You can have any number of Terms and those Terms can be any number of weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"p-tn-t-18 m-tn-b-9\">Weeks</h3>\r\n<p>It is the idea of a week where our thinking gets rigid. We tend to think of a week as 5 consecutive school days or, more specifically, as September 3rd through the 7th. However, Flexible Homeschool App treats a week much more flexibly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, in the app, Week 3 is simply the third week you do school, not specifically September 3rd - 7th. So if you take two calendar weeks to complete Week 3, the app can handle it without any effort on your part because a week is considered a timeframe for flexible planning and execution, not a rigid set of dates on a calendar.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"p-tn-t-18 m-tn-b-9\">Segments (Days)</h3>\r\n<p>When scheduling School Work in the app, the concept of “Segments Per Week” is used (For instance, 3 segments per week) rather than the actual dates on the calendar (Sept 3rd, 5th & 7th).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Segments are roughly equivalent to weekdays. They can even be labeled accordingly. For instance, you could do two segments of math on Tuesday if you had to get things done more quickly that week. You can even change the Weekday label if you like. The app easily flexes around the realities of your life.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"p-tn-t-18 m-tn-b-9\">Pro Tips</h3>\r\n<p>Because the app is built around flexible timeframes, there are three pro tips we want to share with you right from the top.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"well well-primary p-tn-9 m-tn-b-18 m-sm-h-18 m-md-h-36 m-lg-h-54\">\r\n\t<div class=\"well-icon\"><i class=\"fss-info\"></i></div>\r\n\t<div class=\"well-message\">\r\n\t\t<p>First, when using the app to plan a School Year, don’t concern yourself with interruptions (potential sickness, vacations, etc). Simply insert the total number of weeks you intend to do school for each Term. You can start and stop school as needed—Flexible Homeschool App won’t even notice.</p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"well well-primary p-tn-9 m-tn-b-18 m-sm-h-18 m-md-h-36 m-lg-h-54\">\r\n\t<div class=\"well-icon\"><i class=\"fss-info\"></i></div>\r\n\t<div class=\"well-message\">\r\n\t\t<p>Second, when setting up School Work, you will be asked to enter General Instructions. Be sure to keep them general—that is—flexible. For instance, \"Read one chapter per segment” is general and helpful. It doesn’t matter if you speed up, slow down or even stop schooling for a bit. It’s a general goal for every Segment.</p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"well well-primary p-tn-9 m-tn-b-18 m-sm-h-18 m-md-h-36 m-lg-h-54\">\r\n\t<div class=\"well-icon\"><i class=\"fss-info\"></i></div>\r\n\t<div class=\"well-message\">\r\n\t\t<p>Third, keep in mind that a segment represents a standard day’s worth of work. If you want to do two sections of your math curriculum each day — three days a week — make a note in the General Instructions that two sections of math are to be completed per segment. Then schedule three segments for math each week.</p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you get going, the flexibility of the app and the tremendous advantage that flexibility provides will become much more obvious, but it’s good to be familiar with these foundational concepts before you begin.</p>",

You can also see the School Work you plan to do for the selected Week. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clicking a School Work item’s “Show Info” button reveals its General Instructions and its attached Resources. This is a useful reminder, especially for older kids who do more independent work. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will be discussing the workflow for a typical School Week and all of the options you may choose to use in the app.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"p-tn-t-18 m-tn-b-9\">Before the School Week:</h3>\r\n<h4>Adjust the Week</h4>\r\n<p>If you need to alter your general plan to fit the specific week you’re facing, you can quickly fine tune things in several ways. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>While in the Tracking section, click the edit button in the toolbar. You will be presented with a number of options like: moving segments to a new week or an existing week, inserting or deleting segments and editing weekday labels.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"p-tn-t-18 m-tn-b-9\">Before the School Day:</h3>\r\n<p>Depending on your preferences, there are several things you may choose to do before the school day begins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A segment of School Work can be updated by clicking the segment to reveal its form.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Check “Do Next” (optional)</h4>\r\n<p>Clicking “Do Next” for each segment of School Work you intend to complete is a quick way to plan your day. The color of the segment will turn orange and you will be able to easily see what needs to be done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can quickly set the day’s work to “Do Next” by clicking the edit button in the toolbar. Select the action ‘Mark “Do Next”’. Select the segments you would like to be done next or select the Weekday you would like to be done next if using Weekday Labels. Then click “Update”.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Insert A Note (optional)</h4>\r\n<p>Click the “Notes” button. A scratch pad editor will appear. Insert any specific instructions you have for the item of School Work for that week. Notes save automatically. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>If a note is present, the \"Notes\" button will turn orange to notify other users that a note exists.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"p-tn-t-18 m-tn-b-9\">During the School Day:</h3>\r\n<p>Once the School Day begins there are a number of features you may use depending on how much data you want to record for later reporting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you plan to create comprehensive reports that detail your activities, you may want to use some or all of the following options.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Select Completion Date (optional)</h4>\r\n<p>Click the “Completion Date” input and a calendar will open that allows you to choose the date on which the segment of School Work was completed.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Insert Completion Time (optional)</h4>\r\n<p>In the “Completion Time” field you can record the amount of time, in minutes, that was spent on that segment of School work.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Insert Completed Work (optional)</h4>\r\n<p>The “Completed Work” section is for recording what was actually accomplished during the Segment of School Work.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Check Complete</h4>\r\n<p>The one feature that really isn’t optional is the “Complete” checkbox. Once selected its segment will turn red. If all the segments for the item of School Work have been completed, they will all turn green.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to quickly mark a lot of segments Complete, click the edit button in the toolbar. Select the action ‘Mark “Complete”’. Select the segments you would like to be marked Complete. Then click “Update”.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"p-tn-t-18 m-tn-b-9\">After the School Day (Optional):</h3>\r\n<p>Once the School Day is done, you may wish to go back over each segment of School Work and double check that all the desired data has been recorded correctly. Especially if you have Students who are doing work on their own and recording it for themselves in the app.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That completes our walk through of the daily workflow.

To edit: select an item, click the “Edit” button in the toolbar, make any desired changes and click the update button. To delete: select an item, click the “Delete” button in the toolbar and confirm the delete. It’s a pretty straightforward process.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>The majority of your preparation time will be spent in School Work. So let’s walk through adding an item of school work. I’ll point out some key features and best practices along the way.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"p-tn-t-18 m-tn-b-9\">Step One: Information</h3>\r\n<p>To begin, select the student or students for whom you wish to create this item of School Work. Then give it a name. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>A useful naming convention is: subject, colon, school work name. For instance, “Reading: The Outsiders.” This will keep all of the Work for a particular subject listed together because School Work is always listed alphabetically in the app.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, you can provide some general instructions. These instructions will appear in the Tracking section where daily work is completed. They are intended to be general in order to maintain the flexibility of the app. For instance, “Read one chapter per segment.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To move forward to the next segment, either click the number 2 circle above the form or the “Next” button at the bottom of the form.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"p-tn-t-18 m-tn-b-9\">Focus: School Work Form</h3>\r\n<h4>Step Two: Resources</h4>\r\n<p>Now you can attach resources to your item of School Work. This can be done in one of two ways. The first is to search existing resources - resources that have already been entered into the app.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Search for “The Outsiders.” It has never been entered, so you’ll have to add it to the app. Fortunately there is a convenient way to attach new resources from right inside the form. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can choose from one of the six resource types: Book, Link, Audio, Video or Application. Click the book icon. Fill out the form. Click the “Attach Book” button.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The Outsiders” is now listed under “Attached Resources.” If you search for “The Outsiders,” it is now available because you have added it into the app. Should you ever wish to edit or delete “The Outsiders,” you can do so through the resource manager.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click to go to the next section of the School Work form.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Step Three: Schedule</h4>\r\n<p>To schedule the work, begin by selecting the School Year, 2019-2020. It has three terms that last 12 weeks. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>We want to read “The Outsiders” two times or Segments per Week during the First Term. So go ahead and select “2 Segments per Week” from the preset dropdown menu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there is a problem. You have now scheduled to read “The Outsiders” 24 times during the First Term. Your General Instructions said to read one chapter per segment but “The Outsiders” is only 12 chapters long. You need to do some fine tuning to your schedule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click the “Show Individual Weeks” button. Delete the scheduled segments for weeks 7 through 12. So now you have scheduled “The Outsiders” to be read one chapter per segment, two segments per week for the first six weeks of Term One. That’s twelve chapters. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click to go to the final section of the School Work form.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Step Four: Weekday Labels</h4>\r\n<p>Finally we have the opportunity to set a general weekly schedule with Weekday Labels. In this instance our work is only ever scheduled to happen twice a week. Let’s select Tuesdays and Thursdays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can adjust things one week at a time in the Tracking section for the occasional change. Or we come back here to the Planning section and change our entire schedule for a completely different approach if necessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And that completes our walk through of the planning workflow. Happy Homeschooling.</p>",

To delete: select a Report, click the “Delete” button in the toolbar and confirm the delete.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To get a better understanding of the power and flexibility of Reports, let’s walk through the creation of three reports you might find helpful.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"p-tn-t-18 m-tn-b-9\">Report One: Weekly School Work</h3>\r\n<p>Some homeschool families find it useful to print a weekly report for each child that shows the School Work they need to do that week. Give the report a meaningful name, “Weekly School Work.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because this report will focus on School Work, turn off the School Year section. The Terms and Resources sections are already unchecked by default on new Reports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That leaves you with the School Work section. Uncheck: Progress Bar, Time Statistics and Schedule Statistics. These items are not pertinent to helping a Student see what is expected that week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That leaves you with General Instructions, which will let the Student know what is expected with each item of School Work, and Attached Resource, which will let the Student know what Resources are to be used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You also want to turn on Weekly Data. This will show each Segment scheduled and its related information. Turn off the progress bar for Weekly Data and click the “Save” button.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now you can choose the Student, Year, Term and Week you want and have a printable report of what’s expected for that week.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"p-tn-t-18 m-tn-b-9\">Report Two: Resources</h3>\r\n<p>Many homeschoolers like to include a list of Resources in each child’s portfolio. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Create a new Report and name it “Resources.” You can uncheck the School Year section and the School Work section. The Terms section is unchecked by default on all new Reports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turn on the Resources section. Its options are already set to what we want for this Report. Leave “Description” unchecked. Descriptions can be lengthy and provide more information than needed for a simple Resource list. Click the “Save” button.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now you can choose the Student and Year you want, then set the Term to “All Terms” creating a printable report of the resources used for that year.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"p-tn-t-18 m-tn-b-9\">Report Two: Year End</h3>\r\n<p>Many homeschoolers like to include a summary of the year’s work in each child’s portfolio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Create a new Report and name it “Year End.” The School Year section and the School Work section are on by default. The Terms section and the Resources section are unchecked by default. This is exactly what you want.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leave everything checked under the School Year section. This report is designed to focus on broad statistics for the School Year.  So uncheck “General Instructions” under School Work and leave Weekly Data unchecked. Click the “Save” button.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now you can choose the Student and Year you want, then set the Term to “All Terms” creating a printable report of activities for the School Year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That completes our walk through of the reporting workflow.
